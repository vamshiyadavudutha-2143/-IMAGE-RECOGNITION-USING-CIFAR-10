# -IMAGE-RECOGNITION-USING-CIFAR-10
Image classification is a vital part of digital image analysis, primarily applied in facial/image recognition, autonomous driving, and image stitching. This project examined the accuracy of different classification models by using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 images classified exclusively into ten classes.
